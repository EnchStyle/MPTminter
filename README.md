## 💡 Usage Guide

### Creating a Token

1. **Token Information**
   - Symbol: 3-12 character identifier (e.g., "USD", "GOLD")
   - Name: Full descriptive name
   - Description: Detailed information about your token
   - Scale: Number of decimal places (0-15)

2. **Token Properties**
   - Maximum Supply: Total tokens that can exist (optional)
   - Transfer Fee: Percentage fee on transfers (0-50%)
   - Special Features: Lock, auth requirements, escrow, etc.

3. **Metadata (Optional)**
   - Icon URL: Link to token logo
   - Asset Class: Category (RWA, stablecoin, gaming, etc.)
   - Weblinks: Official sites, docs, social media

### Managing Tokens

Use the **MPT Manager** (bottom-right button) to:
- View all tokens you've created
- Check tokens you're authorized to hold
- Remove unused authorizations (zero balance)
- Inspect any wallet's token holdings

### Amount Entry

With the enhanced scaling system:
- Enter the actual amount you want (e.g., 1000 = 1000 tokens)
- The system automatically handles decimal conversion
- Scale only affects display precision, not entry

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### tecNO_AUTH Error
This occurs when:
- The holder hasn't been authorized for the specific token
- You're trying to use an old authorization for a new token
- Solution: Use MPT Manager to check and clean up authorizations

### Connection Issues
- Ensure you're connected to the internet
- Check if XRPL mainnet is operational
- Try the reconnect button in the connection status

### Transaction Failures
- Verify sufficient XRP balance for fees
- Check all required fields are filled
- Review error messages for specific issues
