### To Run the Application

```bash
# Quick start
./start.sh

# Or manually
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Production Deployment

The application is ready for deployment on Netlify or any static hosting service:

cd frontend
npm run build
# Deploy the dist/ folder
```

## No Breaking Changes

The application functionality remains exactly the same - just better organized!
